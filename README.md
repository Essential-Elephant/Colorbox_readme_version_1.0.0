User manual for Colorbox ( being updated daily! )


<h1> General </h1>
<h2> Making of</h2>
<p1> This tool started out as a way to finally stop having to copy so many hex codes when working with specific colors, but what it turned into was a bridge to the ultimate color add-on. For centuries artists have had immediate access to their colors, so this seemed like an essential tool. We have set out to build something awsome and we have so much planned for phase 2. Please support and share our work if you would like to see the development of this add-on and other add-ons by Essential Elephant.
  <h2> Getting started </h2>
<p2>Colorbox comes as a single zip file that you can install from the add-ons tab in user preferences.
<h1> Color Swapper </h1>
  <h2> -Collection and palette indicator </h2>

<p1>At the top of the Color Swapper tab you will see a collection name and a palette name, you can use the corresponding arrows to navigate through the current palettes you have available</p2>
  <h2> -Effect buttons </h2>
  <p1>Below the collection and palette indicator you will see our effects buttons</p1>
  <h3>___Apply palette </h3>
  <p1>This takes the current selection and applys it to the collection field</p1>
  <h3>___Auto-apply</h3>
<p1>When you toggle this switch on it will auto-apply the palette you have in the indicator while you navigate</p1>
  <h3>___Shuffle colors</h3>
<p1>This button will shuffle only the colors in the collection field</p1>
  <h2> -Collection field</h2>
<img width="244" alt="2021-06-23 20_24_19-Blender" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81212930/123148943-0a9e6100-d461-11eb-9691-86a566e45fd4.png">
  <p1> This collection field functions very similar to how vertex groups and face groups operate. You can add in collections and with them selected go to your node editor and right click on color field and go down to where it says "Add to color swapper", once this is selected it will become a child of whichever collection you have selected and be driven by the color of that collection.</p1>
<h1> Palettes </h1>
  <p1> Here you can name, import, export, and manage your color palettes</p1>
<h1> Color Ramps </h1>
<p1> This tab will store all of your color ramps that you have made. Here you can apply any color ramp directly to your node editor with the left arrow button</p1>
<h1> Support </h1>
  <p1>This tool was a long time in the making and we think of it as a needed companion in the era of high speed design. We have a long term vision with this product and see so much more potential but now it is up to Blender users like you to help us make this into a truly epic tool. We are committed to an LTS model and want your feedback as we are eager to grow this tool to best fit the artists that need it most.</p1>
